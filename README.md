# Scenario
You work for a company that specialises in providing small-scale full stack web applications to small and
medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and charities. You have been approached by an independent gym and
fitness class franchise "Your Local Gym" (YLG) who wish to develop a web application that allows new
members to easily apply for membership online, and book fitness classes. The staff at YLG should be
able to browse the membership applications, easily search and filter them and change their status
between 'pending', 'accepted', and 'banned'. They should also be able to publish details of upcoming
fitness classes. Prospective members should be able to create a user account in the application, apply
for membership using an online form, and directly message the YLG staff to ask for details concerning
progress of their application(s) or details of fitness classes. Any 'accepted' member should also be able
to see the fitness class timetable.
The business does not have an internal IT department and they have contracted your company to
provide a minimum viable product meeting the requirements listed above.

# Assessment Task
Following a brief feasibility study, your manager has tasked you with producing a Node JS RESTful API
and React JS SPA prototype for the client, which should include appropriate API and code
documentation and endpoint tests to ensure its future maintainability and robustness. They have also
asked you to record a short demonstration video for the client to showcase the functionality available,
demonstrate the tests and show the API documentation.
